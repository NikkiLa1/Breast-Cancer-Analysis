<h1>Breast Cancer Analysis</h1>

 ### [YouTube Project Presentation](https://youtu.be/_Nee-mM-UXw?si=wWuHwkp6lO7Hfo-Q)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on breast cancer prediction using the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning. Employing diverse algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest, the study compares their effectiveness in predicting benign or malignant cases. Noteworthy results include KNN achieving 97% accuracy with optimal hyperparameter tuning, Naive Bayes demonstrating a balanced sensitivity-specificity trade-off, and Random Forest emerging as the top-performing model with 94.74% accuracy. Feature selection, particularly using only "mean" features, influenced model robustness, while "concave points_mean" consistently emerged as crucial for classification. The Random Forest model stands out as the best choice for breast cancer diagnosis, with real-world implications for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes through early detection.
